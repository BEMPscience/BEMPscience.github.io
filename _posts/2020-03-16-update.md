Welcome folks. It's monthly monitoring week here at BEMP. 
----
****
As we have for over 20 years our folks are out collecting data up and down the Rio Grande. This time it's without our usual
community science members. COVID-19 protocols are in place in Neuvo Mexico and we are following them enthusiastically. 

We will be using this blog space and some other social media tools to keep folks in touch with our ongoing 
environmental education, data collection and analysis, and updates on-going field work. 


This is from the far northern end of the bosque during October, 2019.
